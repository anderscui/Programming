**data structures**

**list** in Python is similar to the generic **List<T>** type in C#, it's mutable.

**tuple**s are immutable, they are usually used in cases where a statement or a func can safely assume that 
    the collection of values i.e. the tuple of values will not change. In C#, there is also a generic type **tuple<T>**.

**lists**, **tuples** and **strings** are examples of sequences, what are common to them?
