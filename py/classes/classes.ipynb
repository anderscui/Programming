    "## Polymorphism Dynamic Binding and Duck Typing\n",
    "\n",
    "*Dynamic binding* (also sometimes referred to as polymorphism when used in the context of inheritance) is the capability to use an instance without regard for its type. It is handled entirely through the attribute lookup process described for inheritance in the preceding section.\n",
    "\n",
    "A critical aspect of this binding process is that *it is independent of what kind of object obj is*. Thus, if you make a lookup such as obj.name, it will work on any obj that happens to have a name attribute. This behavior is sometimes referred to as duck typing in reference to the **adage “if it looks like, quacks like, and walks like a duck, then it’s a duck.”**\n",
    "\n",
    "This latter approach is often used to maintain a loose coupling of program components. One of the most common\n",

    "It is recommended that private attributes be used when defining mutable attributes via properties. By doing so, you will encourage users to use the property name rather than accessing the underlying instance data directly (which is probably not what you intended if you wrapped it with a property to begin with).\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, don’t confuse the naming of private class attributes with the naming of “private” definitions in a module.A common mistake is to define a class where a single leading underscore is used on attribute names in an effort to hide their values (e.g., `_name`). In modules, this naming convention prevents names from being exported by the `from module import *` statement. However, in classes, this naming convention does not hide the attribute nor does it prevent name clashes that arise if someone inherits from the class and defines a new attribute or method with the same name.\n",

First, the class might be inheriting from a base class whose instances are immutable.This is common if defining objects that inherit from an immutable built-in type such as an integer, string, or tuple. The other major use of `__new__()` is when defining metaclasses.\n",

    "Once created, instances are managed by reference counting. If the reference count reaches zero, the instance is immediately destroyed.When the instance is about to be destroyed, the interpreter first looks for a `__del__()` method associated with the object and calls it. (A better approach may be to define a method such as `close()` that a program can use to explicitly perform a shutdown.)\n",
