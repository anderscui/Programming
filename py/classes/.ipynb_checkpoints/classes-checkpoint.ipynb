    "## Polymorphism Dynamic Binding and Duck Typing\n",
    "\n",
    "*Dynamic binding* (also sometimes referred to as polymorphism when used in the context of inheritance) is the capability to use an instance without regard for its type. It is handled entirely through the attribute lookup process described for inheritance in the preceding section.\n",
    "\n",
    "A critical aspect of this binding process is that *it is independent of what kind of object obj is*. Thus, if you make a lookup such as obj.name, it will work on any obj that happens to have a name attribute. This behavior is sometimes referred to as duck typing in reference to the **adage “if it looks like, quacks like, and walks like a duck, then it’s a duck.”**\n",
    "\n",
    "This latter approach is often used to maintain a loose coupling of program components. One of the most common\n",

When `__slots__` is defined, the attribute names that can be assigned on instances are restricted to the names specified. Otherwise, an AttributeError exception is raised. In reality, `__slots__` was never implemented to be a safety feature. Instead, it is actually a **performance optimization** for both memory and execution speed. Instances of a class that uses `__slots__` no longer use a dictionary for storing instance data. Instead, a much more compact data structure based on an array is used.\n",

    "User-defined objects can be made to work with all of Python’s built-in operators by adding implementations of the corresponding special methods to a class. For example, if you wanted to add a new kind of number to Python, you could define a class in which special methods such as `__add__()` were defined to make instances work with the standard mathematical operators."
