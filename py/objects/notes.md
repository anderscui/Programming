# Terminology

Every piece of data stored in a program is an **object**. Each object has an **identity**, a **type**(or class), and a 
**value**.

When you write `a = 42`, an integer object is created with the value of 42. You can view the identity of an object as
 a pointer to its location in memory. a is a name that refers to this specific location.
  
The type of an object, also known as its class, describes the internal representation of the object as well as the 
methods and operations that it supports. When an object of a particular type is created, that object is called an 
**instance**.

After an instance is created, its identity and type cannot be changed. But its value can be modified( **mutable** ) or
 not ( **immutable** ).

An object that contains references to other objects is said to be a **container** or **collection**.

Most objects are characterized by a number of data **attributes** and **methods**.
