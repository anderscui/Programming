# Data Structures

## Arrays

An array is a numbered seq of elements of a specific len.

## Slices

Slices are a key data type in Go, giving a more powerful interface to seq than arrays. 

## Range

Range iterates over elements in a variety of data structures.

## Map

# Structs

Go’s structs are typed collections of fields. They’re useful for grouping data together to form records.

# Interfaces

Interfaces are named collections of method signatures.

To implement an interface in Go, we just need to implement all the methods in the interface. Here we implement geometry on rects.

# Goroutines

A goroutine is a lightweight thread of execution.

# Channels

## Non-Blocking Channel Ops
